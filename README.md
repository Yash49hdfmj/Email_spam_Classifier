# Email Spam Classifier

This repository contains an implementation of an email spam classifier using a Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails based on their content. This is achieved through the use of text preprocessing, feature extraction using a bag-of-words model, and training a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Installation

To run the spam classifier, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the `spam.csv` file in the repository's root directory.
3. Run the Python script to train the model and classify emails.

```bash
python spam_classifier.py
```

## Data Description

The dataset used for this classifier is a collection of labeled email messages. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Category`: The label for each email, either "spam" or "ham".
- `Message`: The content of the email.

The dataset is preprocessed by adding an additional column `spam` which contains binary values:

- `1`: Indicates the email is spam.
- `0`: Indicates the email is not spam (ham).

## Model Description

The model is built using the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The `Category` column is converted into a numerical format, where spam is represented as 1 and ham as 0.
2. **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Extraction**: The `CountVectorizer` is used to convert the text data into a sparse matrix of word counts.
4. **Model Training**: A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the transformed training data.
5. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The model is tested on the test set to evaluate its performance.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the trained model to classify new emails:

```python
# Example ham email
email_ham = ["could you help me?"]
email_ham_count = cv.transform(email_ham)
print("Ham Email Prediction:", model.predict(email_ham_count))

# Example spam email
email_spam = ["free"]
email_spam_count = cv.transform(email_spam)
print("Spam Email Prediction:", model.predict(email_spam_count))
```

## Results

After training, the model can be tested using the test data split. The model's accuracy is measured by comparing its predictions to the true labels of the test set.

```python
# Evaluating the model
x_test_count = cv.transform(x_test)
accuracy = model.score(x_test_count, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
